## Installing a package

You can install any package that you have permission to view. Authenticate to GitHub Packages using the instructions for your package client. For more information, see "Authenticating to GitHub Packages."

To authenticate by adding your personal access token to your ~/.npmrc file, edit the ~/.npmrc file for your project to include the following line, replacing TOKEN with your personal access token. Create a new ~/.npmrc file if one doesn't exist.

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:\_authToken=TOKEN @liamfend:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
